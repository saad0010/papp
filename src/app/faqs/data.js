        "Building a steady stream of organic traffic is no mean feat. It takes time and expertise. But more importantly, it takes a lot of patience. It can take close to 6 months before you start seeing any substantial difference. But consistency and perseverance will be the key here. That may seem long but remember this is organic and white hat-led SEO ranking. It means even once you stop any SEO optimization your website will continue to rank highly, until it is overtaken by other optimized sites. In fact, one major advantage of white hat SEO is that it grows your brand presence across the internet, giving you positive press as it goes along.",
